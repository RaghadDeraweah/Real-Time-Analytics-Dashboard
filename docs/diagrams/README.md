# Diagram Placeholders

This directory should contain exported diagrams referenced by the documentation:

- `architecture.png`: High-level system architecture
- `sequence-diagrams.png`: Combined sequence flows for ingestion and dashboard updates

> **TODO:** Replace the zero-byte placeholder files with real diagrams generated from your preferred tooling (e.g., Excalidraw, Mermaid, PlantUML, Draw.io).
